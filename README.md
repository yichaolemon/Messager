# Messager
Experimental messaging app written in Java. 

## Requirements
Docker, and it may help if you have more than one computers so that one of them can run the server code. I used a Raspberry Pi and it worked really great. 

## TODO: 
1. End to end encryption. 
2. Accounts, logins, credentials, etc.
3. Disk database.
