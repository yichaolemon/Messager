# Messager
Experimental end-to-end encrypted messaging app written in Java. 

## Requirements
Docker, and it may help if you have more than one computers so that one of them can run the server code. I used a Raspberry Pi and it worked really great. 

## TODO: 
- Disk database and persistent public keys for each unique user.
- More features for the repl and better error handling.
